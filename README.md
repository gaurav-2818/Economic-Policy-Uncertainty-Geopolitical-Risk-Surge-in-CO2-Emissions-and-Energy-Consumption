# Economic-Policy-Uncertainty-Geopolitical-Risk-Surge-in-CO2-Emissions-and-Energy-Consumption
The in-depth investigation "Unveiling the Connection: Economic Policy Uncertainty, Geopolitical Risk, and Surge in CO2 Emissions" aims to investigate the intricate relationship between geopolitical risk factors, economic policy, and the rising CO2 emissions.
In the face of the recent surge in CO2 emissions, a significant global concern, the roles of geopolitical risk and economic
policy uncertainty have remained largely unexplored. The research initiative aims to investigate the complex relationship that exists
between a country's energy consumption and a number of important variables, including GDP, inflation rate, CO2 emissions, and the
index of economic uncertainty. By means of a thorough examination of these vital factors, our project seeks to reveal not only their
respective effects but also their combined influence on the trends in energy consumption in a country. Our research aims to shed light
on the intricate relationships between patterns of energy consumption, environmental factors, and economic indicators by dissecting
the complex dynamics at work. This study is important in two ways. Firstly, it aims to provide policymakers and stakeholders in the
energy sector with useful information that they can use to make well-informed decisions regarding sustainable resource management.
Second, it seeks to advance academic knowledge of the complex relationship that exists between energy demand, economic growth,
and environmental sustainability. By exploring these connections, our research aims to equip interested parties with the information
required to create strategies that support sustainable development efforts and promote a more resilient and environmentally friendly
future.
